      <description>Few days back, came across a tech related workshop for kids hosted in partnership with Microsoft and UBC. For sure, such workshops will be very useful.
Such workshops will only be the first step. Parents need to get involved in what their kids are learning in such workshops and provide them an environment to make further progress in what they have learned.
I work with co-op students every day, have interviewed many of them over the past few years.</description>
