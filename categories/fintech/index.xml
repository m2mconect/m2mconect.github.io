      <description>Our next step as a Data Analyst is to divide the problem into smaller, manageable, solvable chunks (disassemble).
Often, your problem will be vague, like this: &amp;ldquo;How do we increase Sales?&amp;rdquo;. The best approach to answer those big problems is to answer the smaller problems, which you’ve analyzed out of the big problem. For instance
How do we increase sales? could be split into
What do our best customers want from us?</description>

      <description>So let&amp;rsquo;s say there is a business run by someone for the past 3+ years selling few products primarily targeted for teens.
