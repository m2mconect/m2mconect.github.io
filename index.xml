      <description>All revolutions are, until they happen, then they are historical inevitabilities - David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas
Todayâ€™s world is an image of a revolution that has happened. We have gone through numerous revolutions to come to this stage. Though there are a number of revolutions around us throughout the various centuries, all these can be classified into three or in other words they can all be boxed into one of the following.</description>

      <description>There has been a new jargon in financial industry &amp;ldquo;Fintech&amp;rdquo; which has been floating around for the past few years. &amp;ldquo;Fintech&amp;rdquo; are technology-first (software based) companies that leverage software to compete with traditional financial institutions.
Traditional brick and mortar financial institutions have to somehow pass their physical location operational costs to their customers in one way or other. Online-only financial institutions fully pass these savings to their customers.
There are already many online-only financial institutions which have made their mark.</description>

      <description>Few days back, came across a tech related workshop for kids hosted in partnership with Microsoft and UBC. For sure, such workshops will be very useful.
Such workshops will only be the first step. Parents need to get involved in what their kids are learning in such workshops and provide them an environment to make further progress in what they have learned.
I work with co-op students every day, have interviewed many of them over the past few years.</description>
