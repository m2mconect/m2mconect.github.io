      <description>Our next step as a Data Analyst is to divide the problem into smaller, manageable, solvable chunks (disassemble).
Often, your problem will be vague, like this: &amp;ldquo;How do we increase Sales?&amp;rdquo;. The best approach to answer those big problems is to answer the smaller problems, which you’ve analyzed out of the big problem. For instance
How do we increase sales? could be split into
What do our best customers want from us?</description>

      <description>So let&amp;rsquo;s say there is a business run by someone for the past 3+ years selling few products primarily targeted for teens. Business has been consistently growing and the team is also expanding. So the CEO hires you (a data analyst) with the hope that you can provide valuable analysis which will help her figure out how to increase sales.
People who possess Data Analysis skills have a massive edge on everyone else, because they understand what to do with all the humongous data, a business has.</description>

      <description>All revolutions are, until they happen, then they are historical inevitabilities - David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas
Today’s world is an image of a revolution that has happened. We have gone through numerous revolutions to come to this stage.

      <description>There has been a new jargon in financial industry &amp;ldquo;Fintech&amp;rdquo; which has been floating around for the past few years. &amp;ldquo;Fintech&amp;rdquo; are technology-first (software based) companies that leverage software to compete with traditional financial institutions.

There are already many online-only financial institutions which have made their mark.</description>
